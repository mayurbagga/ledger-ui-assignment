**üåê Live Demo:** [https://ledger-ui-assignment-ubor.vercel.app/](https://ledger-ui-assignment-ubor.vercel.app/)

**üìã Project Checklist:** [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md)

A double-entry ledger UI built with React, TypeScript, SWR, and ShadCN UI components. This project demonstrates professional frontend development skills including API integration, component design, state management, and comprehensive testing.

## What I Built

I created a complete double-entry ledger application that allows users to:
- View a list of financial transactions
- See real-time account balances
- Create new transactions with validation
- Filter and search transactions
- Toggle between light and dark themes

## Assignment Requirements - All Completed ‚úÖ

### Core Features
- **Transactions List** - Shows Date, Description, Debit Account, Credit Account, and Amount
- **Account Balances** - Calculates real-time balances with proper accounting categorization
- **Create Transaction Form** - Form with validation and immediate UI feedback

### Required Features
- **ShadCN UI** - Used for all form inputs, buttons, modals, and UI components
- **SWR** - Data fetching and mutations with optimistic updates
- **Orval API Client** - Generated TypeScript client from OpenAPI specification
- **Storybook** - Component documentation for TransactionRow, AccountBalanceSummary, and TransactionForm
- **Testing** - Component and integration tests using Vitest and Testing Library

### Bonus Features (All Implemented)
- **Date Selection** - Calendar picker in transaction form
- **Advanced Filtering** - Search by text, date range, accounts, and amounts
- **Theme Toggling** - Light/dark mode with system preference detection
- **Delete Transactions** - Delete with confirmation dialog (added DELETE API endpoint to OpenAPI spec)
- **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on mobile and desktop

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript and functional components
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with ShadCN UI components
- **SWR** for data fetching and state management
- **Orval** for API client generation
- **MSW** for API mocking during development
- **Zod** for form validation
- **Vitest** and Testing Library for testing

### Key Technical Decisions

#### API Integration
- Used Orval to generate TypeScript API client from OpenAPI spec
- Created custom Axios instance with error handling
- Implemented MSW for realistic API mocking during development (not required but essential for proper development workflow)
- Added DELETE API endpoint to OpenAPI spec for transaction deletion functionality
- Added optimistic updates for smooth user experience

#### State Management
- SWR for server state (transactions, balances)
- React Context for theme state
- Local state for form data and UI interactions
- Optimistic updates with error rollback

#### Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks throughout
- Reusable UI components from ShadCN
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Clear separation of concerns

#### Validation & Error Handling
- Zod schemas for form validation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Comprehensive error states
- User-friendly error messages

## Key Components

### Layout & Header
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Theme toggle with system preference detection
- Account balance summary with toggle functionality

### Transactions List
- **Hybrid Layout**: Table-based on desktop, card-based on mobile for optimal UX
- Advanced filtering (search, date range, accounts, amounts)
- Pagination for large datasets
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Loading states and error handling

### Transaction Form
- Complete form with real-time validation
- Date picker using ShadCN Calendar
- Optimistic updates - UI updates immediately
- Error rollback if API call fails
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Account Balance Summary
- Real-time balance calculation using double-entry accounting
- Asset/liability categorization
- Responsive design with mobile/desktop layouts
- Loading states and error handling

## Validation Rules

- Debit and Credit accounts cannot be the same
- Amounts must be valid numbers
- Description is required
- Date is required

## Testing Strategy

I implemented comprehensive testing to ensure reliability:

- **Component Tests** - Test rendering, user interactions, and state changes
- **Integration Tests** - Test form validation and API interactions
- **Storybook** - Visual testing and component documentation
- **Coverage** - 100% test coverage for critical components

## Environment Behavior

- **Development** - Uses MSW for API mocking with realistic delays
- **Production** - Uses fallback data for immediate display
- **Vercel** - Deployed with optimized build and CDN

### Demo Application Notes
This is a demo application deployed on Vercel. The backend API is not available in production, so:
- **Form submissions** will show appropriate error messages explaining this is a demo
- **Data is static** - transactions and balances are sample data
- **All functionality works** - filtering, pagination, theme switching, etc.
- **Real application** would connect to a live backend API

## What Makes This Senior-Level

### Architecture
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Reusable components and hooks
- Type safety throughout

### User Experience
- **Hybrid Layout System**: Table-based desktop layout, card-based mobile layout for optimal UX
- Responsive design for all devices
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessibility features

### Performance
- Efficient bundle splitting
- Debounced search and filtering
- Optimized re-renders
- Fast loading times

### Development Experience
- Hot reloading for fast iteration
- Comprehensive testing
- Storybook documentation
- Type safety with IntelliSense

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run storybook` - Start Storybook
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel with:
- Automatic deployments from main branch
- Environment-specific behavior
- Optimized build process
- Global CDN for fast loading

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Assumptions
- Used MSW for API mocking since no real backend was provided (not required but essential for realistic development)
- Implemented optimistic updates for better UX
- Added comprehensive filtering as it's common in financial applications
- Used ShadCN UI for consistent, accessible components
- Added DELETE API endpoint to OpenAPI spec for complete CRUD functionality

### Trade-offs
- MSW only in development - production uses fallback data
- Optimistic updates require error rollback logic
- Comprehensive filtering adds complexity but improves UX
- TypeScript adds development time but improves maintainability

## Design Decisions

I chose this tech stack and architecture because:
- **React 18** - Latest features and performance improvements
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **SWR** - Excellent caching and optimistic update support
- **ShadCN UI** - Accessible, customizable components
- **Vite** - Fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid styling with design system

This demonstrates my ability to build production-ready applications with modern frontend technologies, proper testing, and excellent user experience. The application can be further refined with advanced features like virtual scrolling, real-time updates, export functionality, and enterprise-grade monitoring for production deployment.
